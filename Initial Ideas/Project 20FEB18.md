# Project Ideas for MSSA Cohort 4 20FEB18

## File Transfer Protocol Proof of Concept
Develop a proof of concept file transfer protocol that utilizes simulated qubits in Q# that is managed by a C# User Interface and 
Translation Layer. Protocol requirements include preshared confirmation key. non-deterministic two generals problem

## Chemical Reaction Simulator
Model molecular interaction based on a database of atomic characteristics. Program needs to be scalable to other platforms.
Program must use multiple models to simulate different potential interactions outcomes. 

## Trial/Jury Verdict Prediction
Utilize Microsoft's CNTK and historical trial data to generate a machine learning algorithm that predicts jury verdicts. 
Incorporate the ability to select multiple models, Bayesian, Genetic, and Machine learned algorithms. 

## Financial Transaction settlement system built on Azure framework for internet storefronts
Purpose: decrease time from customer order to shipment preperation.
Develop an ethereum based financial transaction system that allows small businesses to quickly and securely settle transaction on 
blockchain. Blockchain confirmation is delivered in multiple locations.
